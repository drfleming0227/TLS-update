# TLSv1.2 Requirement

The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) [mandates](http://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that **all credit card processors must retire early versions of TLS from service by the PCI deadline**. 

As part of this requirement, PayPal and Braintree are making this upgrade alongside the rest of the payments industry. PayPal and Braintree are updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. PayPal and Braintree will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections.

For more official, relevant information, see the [PayPal Technical Support website](https://www.paypal-techsupport.com):

## What does this mean for PayPal and Braintree merchants?

Merchants must verify that their systems can use the TLSv1.2 protocol with a SHA-256 certificate. As a merchant, you must make sure that you are up-to-date with security updates including current versions of operating systems, encryption libraries, and runtime environments.

To get started, use the following notes to verify the TLSv1.2 readiness for your environments:

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Java](#java)
* [.NET](#net)
* [PHP](#php)
* [Python](#python)
* [Ruby](#ruby)
* [Node](#node)
* [Native Mobile Apps](#native-mobile-apps)

### Prerequisites 

* These checks assume that you have installed all libraries that the PayPal REST and Braintree SDKs require. 
* For these checks to be valid, run them on a production system or one that *exactly* matches the production configuration.

#### To verify your Java and TLS versions

1. Set the TLS version through the [`SSLContext`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html) class.

1. Verify that Java runtime 6 or later is installed:

    ```
    java -version
    ```

    If you have Java version 5 or earlier, upgrade it. 

    > **Note:** Java 8 is preferred because TLSv1.2 is the default in this Java version.

1. Download the [TlsCheck.java and TlsCheck.jar](java) files.

1. In a shell on your **production system**, run:

    ```
    > java -jar TlsCheck.jar
    ```

    * On success:

        ```
        Successfully connected to TLS 1.2 endpoint.
        ```

    * On failure:

        ```
        Failed to connect to TLS 1.2 endpoint.
        ```

#### Supported SDKs

* [PayPal](PayPal/README.md#java)
* [Braintree](Braintree/README.md#java)

### .NET

* [.NET requirements](#net-requirements)
* [To verify your .NET and TLS versions](#to-verify-your-net-and-tls-versions)
* [Supported SDKs](#supported-sdks-net)

#### .NET requirements

To enable TLSv1.2, you must install the .NET framework 4.5 or later.

#### To verify your .NET and TLS versions

1. Set the TLS version through [`ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol` enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.securityprotocoltype(v=vs.110).aspx).

1. To verify that you have .NET framework 4.5 or later, run [NetFrameworkVersions](net/NetFrameworkVersions) on the console of your production system. If you do not have .NET 4.5 or later, upgrade it.

1. In a shell on your **production system**, run [TlsCheck](net/TlsCheck):

    ```
    > TlsCheck.exe
    ```

    * On success:

        ```
        PayPal_Connection_OK
        ```

#### Supported SDKs

* [PayPal](PayPal/README.md#net)
* [Braintree](Braintree/README.md#net)

### PHP

* [PHP requirements](#php-requirements)
* [Guidelines](#guidelines)
* [To verify your PHP and TLS versions](#to-verify-your-php-and-tls-versions)

#### PHP requirements

* PHP uses the system-supplied cURL library, which requires OpenSSL 1.0.1c or later. 
* You might need to [update your SSL/TLS libraries](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-compared.html).

#### Guidelines

Find OpenSSL in these locations:

1. OpenSSL installed in your operating system's `openssl version`.

1. OpenSSL extension installed in your PHP. Find this in your `php.ini`.

1. OpenSSL used by PHP_CURL.`curl_version()`. <a id="option-3"></a> 

These OpenSSL extensions can be different, and you update each one separately.

The OpenSSL extension that PayPal or any other PHP SDK uses to make HTTP connections is the one that [PHP_CURL](#option-3) uses. The PHP_CURL OpenSSL extension must support TLSv1.2.

The `php_curl` library uses its own version of the OpenSSL library, which is not the same version that PHP uses, which is the `openssl.so` file in `php.ini`.

#### To verify your PHP and TLS versions

1. To find the `openssl_version` information for cURL, run:

    ```
    php -r 'echo json_encode(curl_version(), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);'
    ```

    The returned `php_curl` version might be different from the `openssl version` because they are different components.

1. When you update your OpenSSL libraries, you must update the `php_curl` OpenSSL version, and not the OS OpenSSL version.

1. In a shell on your **production system**:

    1. Download [cacert.pem](php/cacert.pem).
    1. Download [TlsCheck.php](php/TlsCheck.php).
    1. Run `php -f TlsCheck.php`.

        * On success:
            ```
            PayPal_Connection_OK
            ```
        
        * On failure:
            ```
            curl_error information
            ```

These actions help you determine your openssl version.

> **Notes:** <ul><li>Make sure that your command line test uses the same versions of PHP and SSL/TLS libraries as your web server.</li><li>If you use MAMP or XAMPP as your development set up, the PHP that is packaged with them uses an earlier version of OpenSSL, which you cannot easily update. For more information about this issue and a temporary workaround , see [Unknown SSL protocol error](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK/issues/484#issuecomment-176240130).</li></ul>

### Python

* [Python requirements](#python-requirements)
* [To verify your Python and TLS versions](#to-verify-your-python-and-tls-versions)

#### Python requirements

* Python uses the system-supplied OpenSSL. 
* TLSv1.2 requires OpenSSL 1.0.1c or later.

#### To verify your Python and TLS versions

    ```

    For Python 3.x:

    ```
    $ python -c "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('https://tlstest.paypal.com/').read())"
    ```

    * On success:
        ```
        PayPal_Connection_OK
        ```
    * On failure, an `URLError` is raised:
        ```
        urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:590)>
        ```
        ```
        urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer>
        ```

* [To verify your Ruby and TLS versions](#to-verify-your-ruby-and-tls-versions)

#### Ruby requirements

* Both `Ruby > 2.0.0` and `OpenSSL > 1.0.1c` are required:
    * Ruby 2.0.0 or later is required to use TLSv1.2 from the system-supplied OpenSSL.
    * TLSv1.2 requires OpenSSL 1.0.1c or later. 
* To update your dependencies, you might need to run `bundle update`.

#### To verify Ruby and TLS versions

1. For the PayPal legacy Ruby SDK, packaged as `PP_Ruby_NVP_SDK.zip`, download [this update](https://github.com/paypal/TLS-update/blob/master/ruby/PP_Ruby_NVP_SDK.zip).

1. In a shell on your **production system**, run:

        ```
    * On failure, a network error occurs.

## Native Mobile Apps

* [Android](#android)
* [iOS](#ios)
* [Windows](#windows)

### Android

* [Android requirements](#android-requirements)
* [Supported SDKs](#supported-sdks-android)

#### Android requirements

TLSv1.2 is the default for client connections in API 20 (Android 4.4W "KitKat - wearable extensions").

All Android app developers must make sure that their code and PayPal or Braintree SDKs provide explicit support for TLSv1.2. To verify correct implementation, test apps on Android 4.1-4.4 (API 16-19) devices.

After the TLSv1.2 upgrade, native app support for user devices earlier than API 16 (Android 4.1 "Jelly Bean") are not available. Fortunately, as of December 5, 2016, [Google reports 2.5% of devices accessing the Play store are API 15 or earlier](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform).

Users of the PayPal or Braintree Android SDKs must update to the latest version. To illustrate how to support TLSv1.2 outside of the SDK, we have provided an [example Android app](android/).

<a id="supported-sdks-android"></a>

#### Supported SDKs

* [PayPal](PayPal/README.md#android)
* [Braintree](Braintree/README.md#android)

### iOS

TLSv1.2 support was introduced in iOS 5. The [PayPal iOS SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK) and the [Braintree iOS SDK](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios) both require iOS 7 or later. Apps built since 2013 will likely not need any updates.

### Windows

Neither PayPal nor Braintree support any Windows SDKs. For a web browser integration, we recommend [Braintree v.zero for JavaScript](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/javascript+dotnet/guides/client-sdk).
